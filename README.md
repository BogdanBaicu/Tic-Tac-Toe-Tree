# Tic-Tac-Toe-Tree

## About the Project
Being given the next player (X or O) and the initial game board, the program generates the game boards tree and the and-or tree.
A leaf is T if the current player wins the game. An AND node is T if all intern nodes are T. An OR node is T if at least one internal node is T.
